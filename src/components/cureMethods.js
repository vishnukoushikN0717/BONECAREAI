                        <strong>Immobilization with casts or splints</strong> - Stabilizes the bone and allows it to heal properly. This is often the first step in fracture management to prevent further injury. Casts and splints provide the necessary support to keep the broken bone in place and are usually worn for several weeks, depending on the severity of the fracture. During this time, it's important to follow your doctor's instructions on care and activity restrictions to ensure proper healing.

                        <strong>Surgery with internal or external fixation</strong> - Necessary for complex fractures where metal rods, screws, or plates are used to hold the bones in place. This can involve both open and minimally invasive procedures. Surgery is often required for fractures that cannot be properly aligned or stabilized with casts or splints alone. The type of surgery and fixation method depends on the fracture location, type, and patientâ€™s overall health.

                        <strong>Rest and avoid activities that may worsen the fracture</strong> - Essential for proper healing and to prevent further injury. This includes immobilizing the affected area and following your doctor's advice. Rest is crucial during the initial healing phase to allow the bone to repair itself. Activities that put stress on the fracture should be avoided to prevent complications.

                        <strong>Apply ice to reduce swelling</strong> - Ice packs can be applied for 20 minutes every few hours to manage pain and swelling. Be sure to wrap the ice pack in a towel to prevent frostbite. Ice is effective in the first 48 hours following the injury, as it helps to constrict blood vessels and reduce inflammation.
